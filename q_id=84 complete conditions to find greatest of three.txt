In the given code segment complete the if/else conditions
  so that the code finds the greatest of numbers a,  b and c
  If there is no greatest (top 2 or three numbers are equal) the result is -1
The code should store the greatest number (or -1) in variable greatest
int a;
int b;
int c;
int greatest;  /* To store the greatest value */
    if (a>b && a>c)
    {   /* a is greatest*/
        greatest = a;
    }
    else if (b>a && b>c)
    {   /* b is greatest*/
        greatest = b;
    }
    else if (c>a && c>b)
    {   /* c is greatest*/
        greatest = c;
    }
    else
    {   /* No clear greatest number */
        greatest = -1;
    }
