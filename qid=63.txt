The following C program calculates the average of two digit numbers which are accepted from the user.
The novice programmer has failed to include some statements, hence the program gives compile errors.
Please supply the missing statements to make the program compile and execute.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
float avg;
int count,a;

    avg   = 0.0;
    count = 0;
    (void) printf("provide number (> 99 to exit)");
    (void) scanf("%d", &a);
    while ((a < 100) && (a > -100))
    {
        avg += a;
        count++;
        (void) printf("provide number (> 99 to exit)");
        (void) scanf("%d", &a);
    }
    avg /= count;
    (void) printf("%s %f\n", "average = ", avg);
    return(0);
