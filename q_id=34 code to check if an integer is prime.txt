Write code to check whether an integer variable i is a prime.
A prime is defined as a +ve integer greater than one which is divisible only by 1 and itself.
If i is less than 2, the variable isprime should be set to 0
else if i is a prime, it should be set to 1 else it should be set to 0.
int i;  /* The integer which has to be tested if prime */
int isprime;  /* The varaible where the result of the test is stored */
isprime=1;
if(i<2)
isprime=0;
int j;
for(j=2;j<=i/2;++j)
{
if(i%j==0)
{
isprime=0;
break;
}
}
