Write Code to swap elements of an array.
It should swap consecutive elements.
array[0] and array[1] should be exchanged, array[2] and array[3] should be exchanged and so on.
int  e;  /* Number of elements in array */
int *a;  /* Array of elements to be swapped */
int i, j, t;
i=0;
j= e-1 ;
while( i < (e-1) )
{
  t=a[i];
 a[i]=a[i+1];
 a[i+1]=t;
 i=i+2;
}
