Code function calculateStdDeviation to find and return square of standard deviation of all elements of an array.
The function should accept the number of elements and an array of integers as parameters.
It should calculate the average of all the elements of an array.
It should calculate the sum of squares of the difference between each element and the average :sum of all (element-average)*(element-average).
Standard Deviation is the sum of squares of the difference divided by number of elements.
It should return the square of standard deviation of all the elements of the given array.
