  so that the code finds the maximum of numbers a,  b and c using only two if statements
The code should store the maximum number in variable max
int a;
int b;
int c;
int max;  /* To store the maximum value */
    max = a;
    if (b>max)
    {
        max = b;
    }
    if (c>max)
    {
        max = c;
    }
