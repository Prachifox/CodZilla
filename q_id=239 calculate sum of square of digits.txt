Write code to compute the sum of squares of all the digits of a given number.
The number is supplied in the variable num.
The computed sum of squares should be stored in variable sum.
If the number is -ve, the -ve sign is to be ignored.
int num;
int sum;
num=abs(num);
sum=0;
while(num>0)
{
int a=num%10;
num=num/10;
sum+=(a*a);
}
