Cost of a rail ticket for child less than 12 years is 50% of adult ticket.
For senior citizens (attaining age 60) the rail ticket cost is 80% of adult ticket.
For adults the tickets cost is based on distance tarvelled.
For every 50 kilometers or part thereof, the ticket cost is Rs. 20
Write code which computes the ticket cost given age (in variable) a and distance (in variable) d and stires it in variable cost.
int a;  /* Age of traveller */
int d;  /* distance iin km of journey */
int cost;  /* Cost of ticket to be computed */
cost=0;
while(d>0)
{
d=d-50;
cost+=20;
}
if(a>=60)
cost=.8*cost;
if(a<12)
cost=.5*cost;
