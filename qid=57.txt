Write Code to find Median of all elements of an array.
median is the value of the element residing in the middle when the array elements are sorted.
In case the array has even elements the median is the average of the two center elements.
int  e;  /* Number of elements in array */
int *a;  /* Array of elements for which median  has to be found */
float median;  /* Variable to store value of calculated median */
int i,j,t,y,h,o;
float b=2.0;
y=e/2;
h=e-1;
i=0;
while(i!=h)
{
 j=0;
 o=e-1-i;
 while(j!=o)
{
 if(a[j]>a[j+1])
{
 t=a[j];
a[j]=a[j+1];
a[j+1]=t;
}
j++;
}
i++;
}
if(e%2)
median= a[y];
else
median= (a[y-1] + a[y])/b;
