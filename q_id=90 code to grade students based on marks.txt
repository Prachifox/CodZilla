The pass grade of students is determined with the following rules.
    Marks above 85% grade is "DIS"
    Marks above 60% grade is "I"
    Marks above 50% grade is "II"
    Marks including 5 grace marks above 35% grade is "III"
    Everyone else grade is "F"
The students can appear for either 7 or 8 subjects each carrying 100 marks.
Write code which determines the grade and stores it in variable grade
    when number of subjects and total marks are in variable s and m respectively.
int s;  /* Number of subjects attempted by student */
int m;  /* Total marks in all subjects */
char *grade;  /* Variable where grade is to be stored */
    grade = "F";
float x=m/(s*100.0);
if(x>35)
grade="III";
if(x>50)
grade="II";
if(x>60)
grade="III";
if(x>85)
grade="DIS";
