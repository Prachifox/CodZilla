Fixed deposit interest rate for a senior citizen (attaining age 60) is 0.5% more than others.
The fixed deposit interest rate for others is 6.0% per annum for less than 30 days.
Between 30 and 60 days, the fixed deposit interest rate for others is 6.50% per annum.
Beyond 60 days, the fixed deposit interest rate for others increases by 0.25% per annum for every 30 days or part thereof.
The maximum fixed deposit interest rate for others is capped at 8.00%.
Write code which computes and stores the fixed deposite interest rate in variable iRate when variables a and d store age and distance (in days).
int a;  /* Age of depositor */
int d;  /* duration of deposit in days */
float iRate;  /* Computed interest rate */
iRate=6.0;
if(d>=30 && d<=60)
iRate=6.5;
else if(d>60)
{
iRate=6.5;
d=d-60;
while(d>0 && iRate<8.0)
{
d=d-30;
iRate+=.25;
}
}
if(a>=60)
iRate+=0.5;
