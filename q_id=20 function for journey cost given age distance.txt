Cost of a rail ticket for child less than 12 years is 50% of adult ticket.
For senior citizens (attaining age 60) the rail ticket cost is 80% of adult ticket.
For adults the tickets cost is based on distance tarvelled.
For every 50 kilometers or part thereof, the ticket cost is Rs. 20
Write a function ticketCost which computes and returns the ticket cost when age and distance are passed as parameters.
/*
