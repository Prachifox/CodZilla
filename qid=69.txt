Write code to calculate distance by the formula (u times t + half a times square of t).
The code should accept values of initial velocity, acceleration, and time in variables u,a,t respetively
The code should store the value of calculated distance in variable s.
float u;  /* Has value of initial velocity */
float a;  /* Has value of acceleration */
float t;  /* Has value of time */
float s;  /* Value of calculated distace to be stored here */
s=u*t+((a*t*t)/2);

return(s);}
