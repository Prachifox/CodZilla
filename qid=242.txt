Write code to find and store factors of a given integer in an array.
A factor is a +ve integer greater than one which is divides the integer without a remainder.
The number to be factorised is in integer i.
The factors should be stored the in the array f in ascending order.
The number of factors shold be stored in number n.
Note : The number of factors is 1 for all primes greater than 1, it is 0 for all numbers < 2
int f[100];  /* To store the factors */
int i; /* The number to be factorised */
int n; /* To store number of factors */
int k;
if(i<2)
n=0;
else
{
n=0;
label:
for(k=2;k<=i;k++)
{
if(i%k==0)
{
f[n++]=k;
i=i/k;
goto label;
}
}
}
