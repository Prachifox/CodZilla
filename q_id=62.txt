The following C program calculates the total bill based on the number of items and price per item.
The novice programmer has failed to include some statements, hence the program gives compile errors.
Please supply the missing statements to make the program compile and execute.
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int total,items,price;

    total = 0;
    items = 0;
    price = 0;
    printf("provide number of items (0 to exit)");
    scanf("%d", &items);
    while (items <= 0)
    {
        printf("provide price per item");
        scanf("%d", &price);
        total += items * price;
        printf("provide number of items (0 to exit)");
        scanf("%d", &items);
    }
    printf("Total bill = %d\n", total);
    return(0);
}
