Write code to calculate simple interest.
The principle is given in variable p.
The time (in months) is given in variable m (can be non integer).
The rate of interest (per cent per year) is given in variable r.
The simple interest is to be calculated on whole months (ignore partial months).
The calulated interest should be stored in variable si.
float p;  /* Has the principle */
float m;  /* Has the duration in months (can be non integer) */
float r;  /* Has the rate of interest (per cent per annum) */
float si;  /* To store the calculated simple interest */
int t=m;
si=(p*t*r)/1200;
