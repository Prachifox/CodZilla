Write code to calculate velocity by the formula (u + a times t).
The code should accept values of initial velocity u, acceleration a, and time t as parameters.
The code should return the value of calculated velocity in variable v.
float u;  /* Has value of initial velocity */
float a;  /* Has value of acceleration */
float t;  /* Has value of time */
float v;  /* To store value of calculated final velocity */
v=u+a*t;
