Code function calculateMedian to find and return Median of all elements of a sorted array.
median is the value of the element residing in the middle when the elements are sorted.
In case the array has even elements the median is the average of the two center elements.
int  e;  /* Number of elements in  the sorted array */
int *a;  /* Sorted Array of elements for ehich median has to be found */
float median;  /* Variable to store the value of the calculated median */
int y;
y=e/2;
if(e%2)
{
 median= a[y];
}
else
{
median= (a[y-1]+a[y])/2;
}
