In the given code segment complete the if/else conditions
  so that the code finds the least of numbers a,  b and c
  If there is no least (bottom 2 or three numbers are equal) the result is -1
The code should store the least number (or -1) in variable least
int a;
int b;
int c;
int least;  /* To store the least value */
    if (b>a && c>a)
    {   /* a is least*/
        least = a;
    }
    else if (a>b && c>b)
    {   /* b is least*/
        least = b;
    }
    else if (a>c && b>c)
    {   /* c is least*/
        least = c;
    }
    else
    {   /* No clear least number */
        least = -1;
    }
