Write Code to check whether the one integer i is divisible by another integer f.
If i is divisble by f, the function should return 1 else return 0.
int i;  /* The integer to be tested for divisibility */
int f;  /* The possible factor of i to be tested */
int isDiv;  /* To store the result of divisibility test (If i is divisble by f, 1 else 0) */
if(i%f==0)
isDiv=1;
else
isDiv=0;
