Fixed deposit interest rate for a senior citizen (attaining age 60) is 0.5% more than others.
The fixed deposit interest rate for others is 6.0% per annum for less than 30 days.
Between 30 and 60 days, the fixed deposit interest rate for others is 6.50% per annum.
Beyond 60 days, the fixed deposit interest rate for others incraeses by 0.25% per annum for every 30 days or part thereof.
The maximum fixed deposit interest rate for others is capped at 8.00%.
Write a function interestRate which computes and returns the fixed deposite interest rate when age and duration (in days) is passed as parameters.
/*
 * The function interestRate accepts integer a (age of a person) and integer d (number of days)
 * It computes and returns the fixed deposit interest rate based on the age and duration
